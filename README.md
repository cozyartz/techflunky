## 🔧 How Deployment Works

1. **Buyer purchases package** through Stripe checkout
2. **Connects Cloudflare account** via secure API token
3. **Automated deployment** begins:
   - Creates Workers with business logic
   - Sets up D1 databases with schemas
   - Configures R2 buckets for storage
   - Sets up custom domain (or subdomain)
   - Configures DNS and SSL
4. **Business goes live** with dashboard access

## 🔐 Security

- Buyer API tokens are used once and never stored
- Each deployment is isolated to buyer's account
- No cross-account access possible
- Platform fees handled securely by Stripe
- All deployments use HTTPS by default

## 📊 Example: HR Compliance Platform

We include a complete example package for an AI-powered HR compliance platform:

```json
{
  "name": "AI HR Compliance Platform",
  "price": 35000,
  "tier": "launch_ready",
  "includes": {
    "workers": ["api-gateway", "leave-processor", "compliance-checker"],
    "databases": ["hr-compliance-db"],
    "storage": ["hr-documents"],

    ]
  }
}
```
